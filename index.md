## Why "sextant"?

There's a brief moment in _Frozen II_ where Queen Elsa entertains some young
children by creating things for them. Just like a programmer, Elsa loves using
her special skills to benefit other people, especially those she cares about.
Some things she does are pretty easy and straight-forward.

_Elsa has made an ice dinosaur for one young lad, and creates a bear for another._

_A young girl has a special request: "Can you make a sextant?"_

[![Dubious whether she can do this!](thumb067.png)](frame067.png)<br>
_"A what? Errr.... I think so? Let me see what I can do..."_

Elsa's worried that she can't do justice to this request. What if it doesn't
work? What if it's not good enough? What if I disappoint her? I have to try...

_Outwardly: "Here, I made this for you!"_<br>
_Inwardly: "Oh please like it please like it please like it"_

[![Seeing it used for the first time](thumb126.png)](frame126.png)<br>
_Moment of truth! It's being tried out for the first time._

_"Yes!! She likes it!!"_

Observe Elsa's facial expressions during this tiny moment - it's about six
seconds in the final movie - and remember that she's happy to do this, but
still wants to see that it's wanted. THAT is how I feel when I write custom
code for people.
